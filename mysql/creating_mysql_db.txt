To Create your local mySql db for imports, you will need to do:

1) Install MySql.
2) Set root password to "admin"
3) run all the .sql files to create the schema
4) create the import_definitions (get from Ben)
5) create the import_settings (get from Ben)
6) Create your local directory structure for the 
    - importBase (where the files to be imported will be placed)
    - importedFiles (where the files that HAVE been imported will be moved to)
    - importLog (TEMP - where log files will be placed UNTIL the API is in place. )
