So we are currently in Prod (on test server)
We are deployed to the allen server, but we do not have access to the files.

[Thing in progress]

Make it so we can check what files are there and notice any new ones.
- Better imports of SIS data for files that should be re-loaded

[Things to do:]

So we may need to add sftp functionality to get allen files...


Need to clean up the import_prod mySql.  
- Remove unused districts (ie allen, test, etc)
- Figure out what is sorted in prod.

Clean up import_prod on the allen server
- This should only be allen data.  
- Sort out first.

Add a API to clear the import running flag.

**
So we need to review the way sis data is updated.
		○ It now updates student.hasNewSisData.
		○ Verified in sis_grade.
		○ We should clear them out.

When new sis data is detected for active referrals, send the updated sis data.
	- On startup sync active referrals
    - This is now in the student.

** 
Get Melissa Imports set up in Prod.



Only load extra data on API's for new students. (Where applicable)


Add logging

Remove debugging

	
Improve the email that goes out

Better import error handling

Figure out the archiving files.

Confirm new SIS data on loads



Need a way to push stuff to bosco and call the post_sent SPO after a failed import.
